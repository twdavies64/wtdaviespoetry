                                Awake<br>
                                from this short sighted,<br>
                                self serving day dream that  stunts humanity.<br>
                                Awaken!<br>
                                Greedy ones take the coal, blacken the soil, <br>
                                oiling  the wheels with whiskey blood and tears.<br>
                               
                                On the short grass the sheep  still graze.<br>
                                Larger game have left this  place.<br>
                                Even coyote bides his time,<br>
                                always measuring his distance from the gun.<br>
                                <br><br>
                            Yet there are some who measure distance from  inside<br>
                              They read  between  lines <br>
                                of layers left behind.<br>
                                They know this world spins&nbsp; from energy of the sun<br>
                                and by its own momentum turns<br>
                                folding everything within<br>
                                swallowing the past.<br>
                                Through layers of time both dead and alive they walk the ancient canyon.<br>
                                Down an old worn path&nbsp;where steep walls keep old secrets in the still and deep.<br>
                              Whispers on the wind call--<br>
                                To rest beneath the canyon tall&nbsp;and gaze upon ancient tones<br>
                                that morning's&nbsp; mystery brings with light.<br>
                                Its chiseled wisdom worn.<br>
                                Yes, in the wind they listen for the ghost of a moment that calls out!<br>
                                Unfold the mystery that surrounds. <br>
                                Find the thread that runs <br>
                                through everyone and everything<br>
                                And from everywhere a voice will speak <br>
                                to all the  children whom hope holds fast<br>
                                To let go is to understand and <br>
                                roll the rock from off the path.<br>
